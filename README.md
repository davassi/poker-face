Poker-Face is a rust virtusism exercise implementation of a Texas Hold'em poker engine. It evaluates the rank of a 5-card hand using the typical Rust match control flow construct. 
It determines the Rank of a 5 card hand examining the properties using Array Matching and Struct Matching [MatchHandEvaluator](https://github.com/davassi/poker-face/blob/master/src/match_evaluator.rs).

Example of usage of the library, as a binary:

```rust
Poker Face 0.1.0 - ü¶Ä for ‚ô†Ô∏è ‚ô£Ô∏è ‚ô•Ô∏è ‚ô¶Ô∏è
Prehashing cards...

1. Let's shuffle a deck...
 J‚ô•Ô∏è   7‚ô†Ô∏è   9‚ô†Ô∏è   10‚ô•Ô∏è  5‚ô•Ô∏è   K‚ô¶Ô∏è   K‚ô£Ô∏è   K‚ô•Ô∏è   Q‚ô¶Ô∏è   6‚ô•Ô∏è   3‚ô•Ô∏è   J‚ô¶Ô∏è   4‚ô•Ô∏è  
 A‚ô¶Ô∏è   J‚ô£Ô∏è   9‚ô£Ô∏è   5‚ô†Ô∏è   2‚ô†Ô∏è   4‚ô£Ô∏è   5‚ô¶Ô∏è   3‚ô¶Ô∏è   5‚ô£Ô∏è   6‚ô¶Ô∏è   J‚ô†Ô∏è   Q‚ô†Ô∏è   4‚ô†Ô∏è  
 10‚ô†Ô∏è  7‚ô£Ô∏è   9‚ô•Ô∏è   7‚ô•Ô∏è   9‚ô¶Ô∏è   3‚ô†Ô∏è   A‚ô£Ô∏è   A‚ô•Ô∏è   7‚ô¶Ô∏è   2‚ô¶Ô∏è   10‚ô£Ô∏è  6‚ô£Ô∏è   4‚ô¶Ô∏è  
 K‚ô†Ô∏è   A‚ô†Ô∏è   8‚ô£Ô∏è   8‚ô•Ô∏è   Q‚ô•Ô∏è   8‚ô¶Ô∏è   2‚ô£Ô∏è   2‚ô•Ô∏è   3‚ô£Ô∏è   Q‚ô£Ô∏è   6‚ô†Ô∏è   8‚ô†Ô∏è   10‚ô¶Ô∏è 

2. Let's take (actually, borrow) 2 hands of 5 cards each from the deck
Player 1 has:  J‚ô•Ô∏è   7‚ô†Ô∏è   9‚ô†Ô∏è   10‚ô•Ô∏è  5‚ô•Ô∏è  

Player 2 has:  K‚ô¶Ô∏è   K‚ô£Ô∏è   K‚ô•Ô∏è   Q‚ô¶Ô∏è   6‚ô•Ô∏è  


3. Let's evaluate the hands...
Sorted:  J‚ô•Ô∏è   10‚ô•Ô∏è  9‚ô†Ô∏è   7‚ô†Ô∏è   5‚ô•Ô∏è  

Sorted:  K‚ô•Ô∏è   K‚ô£Ô∏è   K‚ô¶Ô∏è   Q‚ô¶Ô∏è   6‚ô•Ô∏è  

Player 1 has a [HighCard with a highcard of value  J‚ô•Ô∏è] 
Player 2 has a [ThreeOfAKind]

4. Celebrate the winner:
The winner is Player 2!


```

As a library, there are some handy macros (newcard!, hand!, assert_rank!) implemented to deal with cards, hands and ranks. Example:

```rust
    assert_rank!(hand!["Ad","Kd","Qd","Jd","10d"], Rank::RoyalFlush);

    assert_rank!(hand!["Kd", "Kh", "Kc", "Ks", "Qd"], Rank::FourOfAKind);

    assert_rank!(hand!["2d", "2h", "Qc", "Qs", "Qd"], Rank::FullHouse);
```

or 

```rust
    assert_eq!(newcard!["Ah"], Card::new(14, Suit::Hearts));
```

## Execute

To run it from cargo, just type:

```console
cargo run -q -- 
```

or to build and install a release from the code:

```console
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
./target/release/poker-face
```

## Contribution
